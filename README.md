# üéì University Management Database Project

This project implements a comprehensive University Management System database using **MySQL**. It models real-world university entities such as students, lecturers, courses, marks, attendance, and results. The goal is to manage university academic and administrative data efficiently, with robust relationships, constraints, and normalization.



## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

The database schema is designed to represent different roles and activities within a university, supporting:

- **User role management** (students, lecturers, technical officers, deans)
- **Course and enrollment management**
- **Attendance and marks tracking**
- **Result and GPA calculations**
- **Handling multi-valued staff attributes** (e.g., multiple phone numbers)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### **Step 1: Create Database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_project;
USE db_project;
```

### **Step 2: Execute the SQL Script**

Copy and run the provided SQL file (with all `CREATE TABLE` statements) in MySQL Workbench or your terminal.

### **Step 3: Verify Tables**

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

### **Step 4: Visualize Relationships**

- **MySQL Workbench** (EER Diagram Tool)
- **draw.io** or **dbdiagram.io**


## üìä Example Queries

**Insert a Student:**
```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('U001', 'student@mail.com', 'pass123', 'ICT');
INSERT INTO student VALUES ('U001', 'R001', 'Active');
```

**Assign a Course:**
```sql
INSERT INTO course VALUES ('C001', 'Database Systems', 3);
INSERT INTO student_course VALUES ('U001', 'C001');
