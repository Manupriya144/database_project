# üéì University Management Database Project

This project is a University Management System database designed using **MySQL**. It models real-world university entities such as students, lecturers, courses, marks, attendance, and results. The goal is to manage university academic and administrative data efficiently with proper relationships, constraints, and normalization.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

This database schema models the essential roles and activities within a university. It supports:

- **User role management** (students, lecturers, technical officers, deans)
- **Course and enrollment management**
- **Attendance and marks tracking**
- **Results and GPA calculations**
- **Handling multi-valued staff attributes** (e.g., multiple phone numbers)
